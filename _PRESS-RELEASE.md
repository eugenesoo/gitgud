There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  
  gitgud 三三ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  
  Helping you get better at using your code editor.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  We spend so much time using our code editor, yet we often do not have the time to get better at it, as there's always something else that requires our attention.

  gitgud exposes you to the most useful features of your code editor that other developers love, in a way that does not take up too much of your time or disrupt your workflow.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Developers wanting to get better at using their code editors, but struggling to find the time/opportunity to do so without impacting their productivity.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  gitgud introduces the most useful features to a developer in bite-sized chunks on a daily basis, so that they are able to use these features in their current workflow, without feeling overwhelmed or becoming less productive.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  If not now, then when?

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Sign up.
  Select your text editor.
  Learn one new feature of your code editor and ways to use it in your daily workflow.
  Start gitting gud.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  'gitgud introduces really useful features to me everyday and shows me how to use in my current workflow. While i could read the feature docs on my code editor, I often do not remember how to use these features and return to using what I'm most familiar with, even if it is less efficient in the long term.' -mnabeshimase
